### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lino ComesaÃ±a. I got my Master's degree in Nuclear and Particle Physics at the University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain, same place where I received my bachelor's degree in Physics.

As an Early Stage Researcher of the Applied Geotechnologies Research Group (Geotech) from the University of Vigo, I developed my Doctoral Thesis under the scope of geospatial data applications through the development of Deep Learning algorithms, with special interest in Multispectral Remote Sensing systems.
