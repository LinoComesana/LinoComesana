### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lino ComesaÃ±a, and I am now a doctoral student at the University of Vigo. I got my Master's degree in Nuclear and Particle Physics at the University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain, same place where I received my bachelor's degree in Physics.

As an Early Stage Researcher of the Applied Geotechnologies Research Group (Geotech), I am now working in geospatial data applications with the development of Deep Learning algorithms, with special interest in Remote Sensing systems that deal with different laser wavelengths (hyperespectral sources).
